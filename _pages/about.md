I received the B.S. degree in Automation from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China, in 2019. I got the recommendation qualification with the first result in the comprehensive ranking of my major and won the president scholarship of Northeast University.

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree in the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. My research interest includes Model Predictive Control, Event-Triggered Control, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, etc. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. PingZhou](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhouping/) of the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries from Northeasterh University.
