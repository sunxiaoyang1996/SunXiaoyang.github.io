I received the B.S. degree in Automation from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China, in 2019. I got the recommendation qualification with the first result in the comprehensive ranking of my major and won the president scholarship of Northeast University.

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree in the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. My research interest includes Model Predictive Control, Event Trigger Control, Reinforcement Learning. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. PingZhou](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhouping/) of the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries from Northeasterh University.
