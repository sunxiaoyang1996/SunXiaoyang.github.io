I received the B.S. degree in Automation from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China, in 2019.

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree in the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. PingZhou](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhouping/) of the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries from Northeasterh University.
